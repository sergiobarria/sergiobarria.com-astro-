        <p>
            I&apos;ve loved building things for as long as I can remember, that&apos;s the main
            reason I became a <strong>civil engineer.</strong> I find passion in learning new things
            and I&apos;m always looking for new challenges. That&apos;s why I decided to become a <strong
                >software engineer</strong
            >.
        </p>

        <p>
            I took my first programming course back in college and I fell inlove with it. I started
            learning by myself and never stopped. I&apos;ve been working as a software engineer for
            a few years now, mostly with <strong>JavaScript</strong>, but also, with other languages
            like <strong>PHP and Python</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            I&apos;m currently working as a full stack developer involved in different projects for
            both web and mobile platforms.
        </p>

        <p>
            When I&apos; not coding, I love playing video games, watching movies or series, learning
            other things that peak my interest, and, spending time with my family.

    <h2 class="mb-6 text-2xl font-bold md:text-3xl">About this Site</h2>
    <div class="prose prose-invert">
        <p>
            Working on my personal website is a way for me to learn, explore and improve my skills.
            One of my biggest mistakes early on was trying to overengineer my website. I was using a
            lot of libraries and frameworks, and I was trying to user the latest and greatest of
            everything, with crazy, overcomplicated designs and animations. I was trying to do too
            much, and I was doing it wrong.
        </p>

        <p>
            The more I work on my style, the more I ejoy working on minimalistic, yet beautiful
            designs. I&apos;m always looking for new ideas and inspirations, to improve my website.
            With that in mind, is not surprise that I find a lot of inspiration in{' '}
            <a href="https://leerob.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                Lee Robinson&apos;s minimalistic style
            </a>
             .
        </p>

        <p>
            One of my challenges when re-building this website was to keep it as simple as I could
            and use as few libraries/third-party packages as possible.
        </p>

        <p>
            The first step was to select a stack. Over the years, I&apos;ve tested several
            frameworks like:{' '}
            <a href="https://nextjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Next.js</a>
             ,{' '}
            <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                Gatsby
            </a>
             , and more recently{' '}
            <a href="https://astro.build/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Astro.</a>
             . And, although I&apos;ve found things I like and don&apos;t like on all of these
            frameworks I finally decided to go with the one I liked the most and felt was better
            suited for this task: <strong>Astro</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            And yes, I know. Even a framework like Astro can be considered overkill to build
            something that can be easily created with simple HTML and CSS like this website. But,
            I&apos;m one of those who think that you should use whatever you prefer as long as it
            can get the job done. So, for that, I think I&apos;m going to give myself a pass on this
            selection ðŸ˜….
        </p>

        <p>
            I&apos;m also a huge fan of{' '}
            <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                Tailwind CSS
            </a>
             (yes, I&apos;m part of the Tailwind cult ðŸ˜Œ), and, I use it every time I can. For a
            database I decided to go with{' '}
            <a href="https://xata.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Xata</a>
             , and, so far, it has been a great DX. Previously I was using Prisma as my ORM with
            Planetscale but I decided to try something different.
        </p>

        <p>
            To add a bit of interactivity, while avoiding using a UI framework like React, I decided
            to take advantage of Astro&apos;s new feature <a
