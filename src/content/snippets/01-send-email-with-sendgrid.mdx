sgMail.setApiKey(process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY)

export default async function handler(req, res) {
  const { name, email, message } = req.body

  const msg = `
    Name: ${name}\r\n
    Email: ${email}\r\n
    Message: ${message}
  `

  const data = {
    to: 'receiver@email.com',
    from: 'sender@email.com',
    subject: 'New email from...',
    text: msg,
    html: msg.replace(/\r\n/g, '<br>'),
  }

  try {
    await sgMail.send(data)

    res.status(200).json({
      message: 'success',
    })
  } catch (error: any) {

## How to use

### 1. Login to or create a SendGrid account

Login to your [SendGrid account](https://app.sendgrid.com/login), if you don't have one, you can create one [here](https://signup.sendgrid.com/) for free.

### 2. Add sender auth

We need to let SendGrid know which domains are authorized to send emails. To do this:

1. In your SendGrid dashboard, navigate to settings (on the left panel).
2. Click on Sender Authentication -> Authenticate Your Domain. Add your domain info.
3. Once you're finished, you should get 3 new DNS Records to add to your DNS provider.

### 3. Generate an API key

In your dashboard, go to settings -> API Keys. Click on `Create API Key`.

Give your key a meaningfull name so you can remember what it does. Then select API Key Permissions and create your key.

Remember to save your key in your `.env.local` file inside your Next Js project and don't push it to Github.

### 4. Create API route

Inside your `api` folder add the code snippet in your project API route. You can name the route however you want.
